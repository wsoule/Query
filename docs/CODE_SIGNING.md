# Code Signing Setup for Query

This guide walks you through setting up code signing for macOS and the required GitHub secrets.

## Prerequisites

- Apple Developer account ($99/year) - [developer.apple.com](https://developer.apple.com)
- Xcode installed on your Mac
- Access to your GitHub repository settings

## macOS Code Signing

### Step 1: Create a Developer ID Application Certificate

1. Open **Keychain Access** on your Mac
2. Go to **Keychain Access > Certificate Assistant > Request a Certificate from a Certificate Authority**
3. Enter your email and select "Saved to disk"
4. Go to [developer.apple.com/account/resources/certificates](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/certificates)
5. Click **+** to create a new certificate
6. Select **Developer ID Application** (for distributing outside App Store)
7. Upload your Certificate Signing Request
8. Download and double-click to install the certificate

### Step 2: Export the Certificate

1. Open **Keychain Access**
2. Find your "Developer ID Application: Your Name (TEAM_ID)" certificate
3. Right-click > Export
4. Choose .p12 format
5. Set a strong password (you'll need this later)

### Step 3: Base64 Encode the Certificate

```bash
base64 -i Certificates.p12 -o certificate.txt
```

The contents of `certificate.txt` will be your `APPLE_CERTIFICATE` secret.

### Step 4: Create an App-Specific Password

1. Go to [appleid.apple.com](https://appleid.apple.com)
2. Sign in and go to **Security > App-Specific Passwords**
3. Generate a new password for "Query Notarization"
4. Save this password (you'll use it as `APPLE_PASSWORD`)

### Step 5: Find Your Team ID

```bash
# List all signing identities
security find-identity -v -p codesigning

# Your Team ID is the 10-character code in parentheses
# Example: "Developer ID Application: John Doe (ABC1234567)"
# Team ID = ABC1234567
```

## GitHub Secrets Setup

Go to your repository **Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions** and add:

| Secret                       | Description                         | Example                                          |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `APPLE_CERTIFICATE`          | Base64-encoded .p12 certificate     | (contents of certificate.txt)                    |
| `APPLE_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD` | Password for the .p12 file          | your-p12-password                                |
| `APPLE_SIGNING_IDENTITY`     | Full certificate name               | Developer ID Application: Your Name (ABC1234567) |
| `APPLE_ID`                   | Your Apple ID email                 | you@example.com                                  |
| `APPLE_PASSWORD`             | App-specific password               | xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx                              |
| `APPLE_TEAM_ID`              | Your 10-character Team ID           | ABC1234567                                       |
| `KEYCHAIN_PASSWORD`          | Any random password for CI keychain | random-secure-password                           |

## Tauri Updater Keys (Optional)

For auto-updates, generate a key pair:

```bash
bun tauri signer generate -w ~/.tauri/query.key
```

Add to GitHub secrets:
| Secret | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY` | Contents of ~/.tauri/query.key |
| `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY_PASSWORD` | Password you set when generating |

Add public key to `tauri.conf.json`:

```json
{
  "plugins": {
    "updater": {
      "pubkey": "YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY_HERE"
    }
  }
}
```

## Windows Code Signing (Recommended)

The release workflow builds Windows installers, but it does not currently sign them. Unsigned Windows builds are still downloadable, but many users will see Microsoft Defender SmartScreen warnings until the app builds reputation.

To reduce those warnings, add Windows signing before the `build-windows` Tauri step:

1. Buy an OV or EV code signing certificate, or configure a cloud signing service such as Azure Trusted Signing.
2. Store the certificate or signing credentials as GitHub Actions secrets.
3. Import the certificate in the Windows job and set Tauri's Windows signing config, or run `signtool sign` against the generated `.exe`/`.msi` artifacts before publishing them.

EV certificates generally build SmartScreen reputation faster, but they usually require hardware-token or cloud-backed signing. OV certificates are easier to automate, but reputation still accumulates over time.

## Testing Locally

Before pushing, test your signing locally:

```bash
# Build with signing
bun run tauri build

# Verify the signature
codesign -dv --verbose=4 src-tauri/target/release/bundle/macos/Query.app

# Test notarization (requires APPLE_ID and APPLE_PASSWORD env vars)
xcrun notarytool submit src-tauri/target/release/bundle/dmg/Query_0.1.0_aarch64.dmg \
  --apple-id "$APPLE_ID" \
  --password "$APPLE_PASSWORD" \
  --team-id "$APPLE_TEAM_ID" \
  --wait
```

## Releasing

1. Update version in `package.json` and `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`
2. Commit changes
3. Create and push a tag:
   ```bash
   git tag v0.1.0
   git push origin v0.1.0
   ```
4. The GitHub Action will automatically:
   - Build for macOS (Intel + Apple Silicon), Windows, Linux
   - Sign and notarize the macOS builds
   - Create a draft release with all installers
   - Publish the release when all builds complete

## Troubleshooting

### "Query is damaged and can't be opened"

Your app isn't signed or notarized. Check the GitHub Actions logs for signing errors.

### "Developer cannot be verified"

The app is signed but not notarized. Ensure `APPLE_ID`, `APPLE_PASSWORD`, and `APPLE_TEAM_ID` secrets are set correctly.

### Code signing fails in CI

Make sure your certificate hasn't expired and all secrets are correctly formatted (no extra newlines).
