# Releasing Query

This repo cuts signed + notarized macOS builds and publishes them through a Homebrew tap whenever a `v*` tag is pushed. The workflow is `.github/workflows/release.yml`.

## TL;DR

```bash
# 1. Bump version in package.json, src-tauri/tauri.conf.json, and src-tauri/Cargo.toml
# 2. Commit + tag
git commit -am "release v0.2.0"
git tag v0.2.0
git push origin main --tags
# 3. Wait for CI — release lands on GitHub + cask bumps in wsoule/homebrew-tap
brew install --cask wsoule/tap/query
```

## What CI does

For every `v*` tag push:

1. **Creates a draft GitHub release** named "Query v{version}".
2. **Verifies the tag version matches** `package.json`, `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`, and `src-tauri/Cargo.toml`.
3. **Builds for macOS** on both arches (`aarch64-apple-darwin` on `macos-latest`, `x86_64-apple-darwin` on `macos-13`). The build is **signed** with a Developer ID Application certificate and **notarized** through `tauri-action`'s built-in `xcrun notarytool` call.
4. **Builds for Windows + Linux** (unsigned).
5. **Publishes the release** (un-drafts it).
6. **Updates `wsoule/homebrew-tap` for stable releases only**:
   - Downloads the two signed DMGs from the just-published release.
   - Verifies Gatekeeper acceptance via `spctl --assess`.
   - Computes SHA256 sums.
   - Writes a fresh `Casks/query.rb`.
   - Commits and pushes.

## GitHub secrets required

| Secret                               | What it is                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `APPLE_CERTIFICATE`                  | Base64-encoded `.p12` of your "Developer ID Application" cert. Export from Keychain Access → right-click cert → Export → set a password. Then `base64 < cert.p12 \| pbcopy`. |
| `APPLE_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD`         | The password you set when exporting the `.p12`.                                                                                                                              |
| `KEYCHAIN_PASSWORD`                  | Any string — used to lock the temporary build keychain. Just pick a random value.                                                                                            |
| `APPLE_SIGNING_IDENTITY`             | The exact identity string, e.g. `Developer ID Application: Your Name (TEAM123ABC)`. Find via `security find-identity -v -p codesigning`.                                     |
| `APPLE_ID`                           | Your Apple ID email.                                                                                                                                                         |
| `APPLE_PASSWORD`                     | An **app-specific password** for `notarytool` ([generate here](https://appleid.apple.com/account/manage)). Not your regular Apple ID password.                               |
| `APPLE_TEAM_ID`                      | Your 10-character Apple Developer Team ID.                                                                                                                                   |
| `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY`          | Tauri updater signing key (optional — only needed for in-app updates). Generate with `bun tauri signer generate -w`.                                                         |
| `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY_PASSWORD` | Passphrase for the updater key.                                                                                                                                              |
| `HOMEBREW_TAP_TOKEN`                 | A PAT with `repo` write scope to `wsoule/homebrew-tap`. Fine-grained PAT scoped to that one repo is preferred.                                                               |

Set them under **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions** on the GitHub repo.

## Local sanity-check before tagging

```bash
# Frontend + Rust compile
bun run build && cargo build --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml

# Full Tauri build with current local signing identity
bun run tauri build
```

The local `tauri.conf.json` hardcodes a `signingIdentity` SHA. CI overrides it via the `APPLE_SIGNING_IDENTITY` env var, so the two paths don't conflict.

## Website downloads

The static site in `site/` fetches GitHub Releases at runtime and maps buttons to the latest published artifacts for macOS, Windows, and Linux.

Production is deployed by Railway from the `Query` service connected to this repo. The live domain is `https://querydb.dev`.

The `Site` GitHub Actions workflow only runs a static-site build check. Do not enable GitHub Pages for this repo.

Local check:

```bash
bun run site:build
```

## Prereleases

Versions with a hyphen, such as `0.2.0-beta.1`, are published as GitHub prereleases and skip the Homebrew tap update. Stable versions, such as `0.2.0`, update Homebrew.

## Verifying a release locally

```bash
brew tap wsoule/tap
brew install --cask query

# Verify the installed bundle is signed + notarized
spctl --assess --type execute -vv /Applications/Query.app
codesign --verify --strict --deep --verbose=2 /Applications/Query.app
```

## Troubleshooting

- **"No identity found" in the Import cert step** — your `.p12` may be missing the private key. Re-export including the private key.
- **Notarization step times out or rejects** — `xcrun notarytool log <submission-id>` for details. Common causes: hardened runtime not enabled (Tauri does this by default), entitlements missing, or app sandboxed without the right entitlements.
- **Gatekeeper assess step fails in CI** — the DMG built but notarization didn't staple. Look at the tauri-action logs for the notarytool output.
- **Tap push fails with 403** — `HOMEBREW_TAP_TOKEN` lacks write access to `wsoule/homebrew-tap` or is expired.
